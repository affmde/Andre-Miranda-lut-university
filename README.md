# lut-university

In this repository I publish my work to complete the Software development skills: Front-end course from LUT University.

The repository has three parts: 
  -my exercises donne during the course;
  -a diary where I write my learnings through the course;
  -my final project, where I created a simple and small website with pictures from the four seasons of the year.

The final project is published in Netlify and can be accessed by the following link:
